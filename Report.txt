Bitcoin News Sentiment Trading Strategy
=======================================

This project presents a rule-based algorithmic trading strategy for Bitcoin (BTC-USD),
leveraging sentiment analysis of financial and geopolitical news headlines. It evaluates
how market sentiment impacts short-term BTC price movements and tests the effectiveness
of sentiment-driven trading decisions.

Overview
--------

- Objective: Use daily crypto-relevant headlines to generate trading signals based on sentiment analysis.
- Approach: Combine Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Bitcoin price data to backtest a Buy/Sell/Hold strategy.
- Timeframe: February 24 – March 15, 2022 (includes key geopolitical events like the Russia–Ukraine conflict).
- Technologies: Python, NLTK (VADER), yFinance, Pandas, Matplotlib

Methodology
-----------

1. Sentiment Analysis
   - Headlines are analyzed using the VADER SentimentIntensityAnalyzer from NLTK.
   - Each headline is assigned a compound sentiment score between -1 and 1.

2. Signal Generation
   - Buy: Sentiment score ≥ 0.2
   - Sell: Sentiment score ≤ -0.2
   - Hold: Score between -0.2 and 0.2

3. Backtesting
   - Align signals with BTC closing prices from Yahoo Finance.
   - Simulate 1-day forward returns for each signal.
   - Evaluate using ROI, win rate, volatility, and drawdown metrics.
